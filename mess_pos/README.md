## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The entire application is currently contained within `lib/main.dart`. It is structured into several key components:

- **Data Models**: Classes like `MenuItem`, `Customer`, `Transaction`, etc., define the core data structures.
- **Service Layer**: A mock `SharedPreferencesService` is used to simulate data persistence. This can be easily replaced with a real database or `shared_preferences` implementation.
- **UI Widgets**:
  - `MessPosScreen`: The main stateful widget that manages the application's overall state.
  - `_AuthScreen`: Handles user login and registration.
  - `_ManagementScreen`: The container for the management dashboard tabs.
  - `_Build...` Widgets: Each management tab (e.g., `_BuildMenuManagement`) is its own dedicated widget.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- **Real Database**: Replace the mock `SharedPreferencesService` with a real local database solution like `sqflite` or a backend service like Firebase.
- **Printer Integration**: Add functionality to print receipts to a thermal printer.
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Create a dashboard with charts and graphs to visualize sales data.
- **Refactor to Separate Files**: Break down the large `main.dart` file into smaller, more manageable files for better organization.
